Hello guys this is Guy here.. and 
I'm so excited because today and in the coming weeks we are going to lern about the thing that related to network on linux,
so this day we start with the ifconfig command.

the ifconfig is shortcat for interface config, we useit for network interface configuration and managment.
we will try todya to coverup the all material, we have alot of stuff to lern soooo... 
Without unnecessary delay, let's get started.


lets openup the man page for ifconfig
So the ifconfig is the way you can manage your network interfaces on your linux machine or check your network activitis.
so if we type ifconfig we can see the IP address of our machine and the subnet mask and etcetera...


just type "ifconfig":
the Link encap stand for link encapsulation 
I hope that you remember the OSI model, but if you don't, lets do quick review...

the OSI model  or Open Systems Interconnection model is a product of  International Organization for Standardization or in short ISO
and [open the OSI.pdf] the OSI model are mentioned in ISO/IEC 7498-1... and as you can see this is a long Document.. but for this level we need the basic

[open the osi-schicht-modell.jpg]
as you can see the OSI is the composition of the layer as follow:
Application - layer 7
Presentation - layer 6
Session - layer 5
Transport - layer 4
Network - layer 3
Data-link - layer 2
and Pysical - layer 1

every leyer encapsulate the upper layer and trasfer the datagram to the next layer and to be precise its transfer to the lower layer
so.. the application are Literally the application.. such as WEB page and this web page - when it need to be transfer through the network,
the machin add to it a haders and than it encapsulated by the Presentation layer, the  Presentation than add his haders and sent is to the session layer,
and so on until the pysical layer that send the data to it's destination on the network.

so  the layer 2 is the data link layer, and in this layer we have some peotocols who encapsulate
the entirely Datagram  which include the upper layers.. the datagram and is't encapsulated at layer 2 are called Frame.
we have a lot of encapsulation protocol such as LLC which stand for Logical link control, we have the ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode,
and we have the Frame Relay, every such protocol encapsulat the Datagram that was creaded from the upper layer and add
to it the source and destination for transfering the frame through the network..

[go back to the terminal]
In our case the encapsulation protocol is Ethernet, and the Ethernet frame are look like that...
[open data_link_layer-eth-frame.jpg]
the really thing that metter to us is the source mac, which in our case are the "HWaddr" which stand for hardware address.
actually, whan you send data to some one on the net your machine use the hardware address as the source MAC address at the frame

the next filed are the "inet addr" which stand for intenet address, the same at layer 2, but in this layer, which is layer 3 - the network, the entirely datagrame with it's encapsulated hader are called packet
and the same as the frame this packet contain the source IP address and destination IP address, in our case the "inet addr" contain the source IP
that the machine use for sending packet through the network

The Bcast are stend for broadcast address for this segment, if we ping to this address every machine on the same segment as our segment will hear the ping
and maybe some of them will replay.

the Mask is the way that your coputer can calculate if the destination IP address are as the same segment that we are.
If you want to know more about it I recommend you to visit the iplocation.net website
and I will link it down below

==========================
the inet6 addr stend for IP version 6
and Scope which stend for
the scope of the area where this address is valid
and in this filed we have some value

############################
global - A global address is what you might currently consider a "normal" address. That is, a unicast address, which is visible on and routable across an external network.

site - Site-local address are supposed to be used within a site. Routers will not forward any packet with site-local source or destination address outside the site.

link - Link-local address are supposed to be used for addressing nodes on a single link. Packets originating from or destined to a link-local address will not be forwarded by a router.

host - A host address is something that will only exist within the host machine itself. For instance 127.0.0.1 is a host address commonly assigned to the loopback interface. The loopback interface has no external connectivity and so it's scope is confined to within that of the host machine.
in thus four you only use when you have IPv6
##############################
==============================


UP meen that the interface is UP and ready to use
BROADCAST meening that the interface are support in BC which is necessary to obtin IP address via DHCP

and MULTICAST This indicates that the Ethernet interface supports multicasting. IP multicast is a technique for one-to-many communication over the network.

MTU stend for Maximum Transmission Unit
this is the unit size for each packet that received by the ethernet card. this value by default for all ethernet device is set to 1500.
if the packet that created are larger than this number than the packt go through fregmentaion or buffer overflows

Metric
This parameter has significance only while routing packets
this option can take a value of 1 and 2 and 3 
and etcetera.. the value is the priority of the interface device, so for example if we want to use one device over the outher one
we can set the metric for the lower value.
Of course, it occurs only when you can get to the destination though both of the interfaces so if we set some interface to be the best priority over the outher one and only the  outher interface has the right way to get to the destination (as should splendid in the routing table), than the metric value 
has no meening.

RX packets stand for the number of the received packet on that interface and the errors: stend for the packet that dropped while the interface received packets,
[open data_link_layer-eth-frame.jpg]
thus packet that are dropped are the packets that found corrupted with the CRC checksum mismatch which is a filed in the frame 
and overrun: refers to high rate that the buffer gets full and the karnet isn't able to deal with it.
the frame filed as far as I know specifies the frame that are correupted which mean that the frame are not a multiple of 8 bits.
and it may include frames that are way too short or way too big.

the TX packets refers to the trunsfered packet through the interface and the same as the RX we have errors filed dropped filed and overrun filed.
the carrier filed stend for carrier sense, and it's refer to the number of times the carrier is lost during a transmission, this filed are always in 0, but if it doesnt it's indicate that the switch or the hub as turned off. 

collisions filed refer to the case that two or more device trasmite onto the same wire at the same time. this is indicate that we have a duplex issues or problem with the phisical connector. if you want to reed more about it you can do a google serch on CSMA/CD.. if you remember this protocol are define how network devices will respond in the case of collision on the network.


txqueuelen - this determine the length of the transmit queue of the device. it's 
actually the buffer size for the framse befor thay are sending out.

RX bytes: stend for the number of bytes that resived on that interface and the TX byted: setnd for the packet that send througth that interface. do NOT confused with the RX and TX PACKET! which are the nuber of the packet that resive in and send out on that interface.

Interrupt - This is usually set by the system.
Interrupt numbers are assigned to hardware devices by the kernel. we can see all interrupt numbers being used by executing cat /proc/interrupts.
so in my case the interrupt is 19 so if we type cat /proc/interrupts and pip grep 19
we can see the line who mach that, as you can see it's the eth0.

base address - as far as I know this is use for the machine can comunicate with that divice you can read about it, just googled input/output base address

You have the next option:
ifconfig -s display a sort table of all interfaces and thire condition, as you can see like the MTU and the RX-ERROR
is the same as netstat -i

ifconfig -a display  all the interfaces! even these who are in down state
and ifconfig -v dispay more verbos of error... this is the default on ifconfig... so if you type just ifconfig without oprtion you  actually use ifconfig -v

in the next option you have the ifconfig interface which you can specify specific interface
as example ifconfig eth0 will display the eth0 interface

if you what to chane the status of the interface you have the UP and DOWN option
as example ifconfig eth1 down.. remember... you need permistion to make such change
so type sudo ifconfig eth1 down 
and now if we type ifconfig -s you can see that  that interface no longer display in that list
if we want know to see that interface anyway just type ifconfig -s -a, you can geas what this will display?
exactly!! it display the sort table of all interfaces even the eth1 that in down state

if you want to assing a static ip address to some interface you need to type as example 
sudo ifconfig eth1 87.192.22.3 and than if we type ifconfig eth1 you can see the ip address that we set on the interface
if you want to delete this static ip from that interface just type
sudo ifconfig eth1 del 87.192.22.3 and now if we type ifconfig eth1 we stil see that ip that we set
so we need to restart that interface
to do that just type sudo ifconfig eth1 down
and than sudo ifconfig eth1 up
and now that interface are use the DHCP request to get a new IP
so if we type now ifconfig eth1
we can see a new ip address on that interface

if you what to set the MASK you can do the same as we do in to assing the ip address all you need to do is type NETMASK and than specified the netmask, and you can do the same to change the broadcast, you just need to type broadcast instend of netmask and than  specified the broadcast address that you wanna use
so as example for netmask
sudo infconfig eth1 netmask 255.255.255.0
and example for broadcast:
sudo ifconfig eth1 broadcast 87.192.22.255

if you want you can combine these tree in one command, as example:
sudo ifconfig eth1 87.192.22.3 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 87.192.22.255
so if we  type now ifconfig eth1, we can see all the things that we set on the interface
the ip address the broadcast address and the netmask.
now if you want to remove these configurations just type again the del before the ip address
sudo ifconfig eth1 del 87.192.22.3 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 87.192.22.255
and than restart the interface
sudo ifconfig eth1 down
sudo ifconfig eth1 up
and now if will go back to the dynamic address
ifconfig eth1

next we can enble or desable arp on that interface just type after the interface name arp to enble or -arp to disable the arp, as example lets disable the arp on eth1
before we to it lets take a look  on the arp
arp
as you can see we have the Address Resolution on the eth0 and eth1
so now type the command:
sudo ifconfig eth1 -arp
and  again the arp command
mmm
we can stil see the  Address Resolution
just lets give it some time for the time out has expired
and now you can see that we have on interface eth1 the incomplete sing under hardware...
becose we disable the arp..
and now lets enable the arp on eth1
sudo ifconfig eth1 arp
and lets type
arp
and you can see the arp
